ESP32 Application Overview
This code is designed for the ESP32 and employs FreeRTOS with three main tasks. It utilizes Wi-Fi and MQTT for sending and receiving data to control movements: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Additionally, it reads a distance sensor every 200 ms to synchronize with MQTT data transmission.

File Structure
The project is organized into three main files:

bsp.c: This file contains the definitions of each API function.
bsp.h: This header file provides the function prototypes for the API functions.
main.c: This file includes the application code, which calls the API functions. This structure simplifies code management and allows for easy switching to different boards with alternative Board Support Packages (BSP).
Additional Information
The running code will be demonstrated in an application built with PyQt, and the sessions will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube. You can view the recordings at the following link:

The source code for the PyQt application will be updated soon.

To explore the structure of each function and see how they are called, you can download the project and view the documentation generated by Doxygen and Graphviz at ./docs/html.
